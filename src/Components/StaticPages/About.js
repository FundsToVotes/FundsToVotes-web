            <p>According to AP-NORC, 53% of Americans know nothing or very little about how money works in politics. After the Citizens United ruling allowed more money in politics, understanding campaign finance became more important than ever. Funds to Votes helps by displaying this data in a user friendly and beginner researcher friendly manner, allowing voters to make more informed decisions. Finally, in addition to helping ordinary citizens decide who to vote for, our product is designed to aid endorsement groups in their research. This helps them decide who to endorse, which enables voters to select candidates according to their values.</p>

            <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "700" }}>Context</h3>
            <li>In 2020, a total of <strong>$14 billion</strong> was spent on political campaigns. (That's the the entire GDP of Madagascar!)</li>

            <li>Voters want and need to know more about their representatives in an easy-to-understand way so they can make <strong>informed decisions</strong>.</li>
            <br />
